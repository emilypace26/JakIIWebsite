      <H1 class="MetalHeads"> Haven City </H1>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">Haven City is a vast, foreboding metropolis, which like any city is divided into distinct areas of varying prosperity and poverty. The City is governed by Baron Praxis and the ordinary folk live under his doctorial rule, in fear of his notoriously short temper. The Baron's Krimzon Guard patrol the streets, stamping their authority at every opportunity, and arresting or even executing anyone for the smallest of misdemeanours. Outside the City walls is a dark wasteland, stretching as far as the eye can see. Few people are brave enough to venture into the wasteland, for fear of attack by the metal heads. </p>

<br><br><br><br>

<H1 class="Abilities4"> The Rule of Baron Praxis </H1>
<H1 class="Abilities5"> Dystopian Haven City </H1>

<p class="textcol3" style="text-align: left;">Baron Praxis was an oppressive dictator who ruled with a relentless hand and, among other wrongs, denied the rights of his people and used lurkers as the city's low-class labor through the Krimzon Animal Control agency; effectively enslaving them. He instituted a corrupt police force known as the Krimzon Guard, the units of which would patrol the streets of Haven City near-unopposed, enforcing the Baron's tyrannical martial law. At this time, Haven City had conclusively become a dystopian state, with the civilians feeling imprisoned inside the city walls. The feeling of depression and imprisonment was further subsisted by the Ministry of Extreme Labor, reporting civilian productivity and forced labor. </p>

<img class="NestPic" src="JakImages/maintown.png" alt="" width="100%">
<br><br><br>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">Haven City was the highest district, though was surpassed when the Water Slums and northern Slums were renovated into New Haven, especially following its destruction and subsequent abandonment. Jak had to traverse Main Town primarily to reach the Mar Memorial Stadium, Tomb of Mar, and the Palace. Additionally, the missions "Rescue lurkers for Brutter" took place partly in Main Town, as well as "Beat Erol in race challenge". This sector was identified with a green barrier.</p>

<img class="NestPic" src="JakImages/bazaar.png" alt="" width="100%">
<br><br>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">The Bazaars were two districts on the east and west side of the Palace in Haven City. Together they served as the city's market, trading goods from produce stands, probably sustained by the surrounding Gardens sectors. Points of interest here included Brutter's trinket stand and Onin's tent. Jak frequented the west Bazaar for the missions "Rescue lurkers for Brutter" and "Beat Erol in race challenge", where both missions at least partially took place, as well as to access other sectors such as the Gardens. He visited the east Bazaar to locate Onin, as well as in the mission "Intercept tanker" when a group of metal heads hijacked an eco tanker and advanced a surprise attack to test Haven's defenses.</p>

<img class="NestPic" src="JakImages/metalNest.png" alt="" width="100%">
<br><br>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">The Metal Head nest is a vast wasteland home to the Metal Head race. As such, a heavy concentration of rare types of metal heads may be found here such as the grunt elephant and flying spider, among others. The nest is also home to Mar's gun, as the legendary figure Mar intended to use it to penetrate the primary part of the nest before his death. The nest itself is located inside a large mountainous structure, surrounded by metal and concrete scaffolding possibly reminiscent of a past civilization.</p>

<!-- mountain temple -->
<H1 class="MetalHeads2"> Mountain Temple </H1>

<img class="NestPic" src="JakImages/temple.png" alt="" width="100%">
<br><br>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">It is a vast network of Precursor structures built among a mountainous forest region north west of Haven City. It is located to the north of the neighboring location Haven Forest. Most of its architecture is constructed of Precursor metal, but is encrusted within a foundation of forestry and other flora, accented with a natural spring and stonework. No Man's Canyon is located here, to the north east regions of the temple. Jak and Daxter were first sent here on the missions "Find lens in Mountain Temple", "Find gear in Mountain Temple", and "Find shard in Mountain Temple", during which they had to recover the lens, gear, and shard artifacts to activate the machinery in No Man's Canyon and find the Tomb of Mar. After completing a Seal of Mar artifact, they returned to the area to access Mar's gate and enter the canyon.
<br>
  Mountain Temple is accessed via a warp gate following the air lock along the western wall in the Northern Garden. It is divided into four separate areas, each with varying platforming challenges, Precursor structures, and other unique features. The area appears to be the natural environment of the hopper, ram head, and manic head metal heads.[a 1][a 2][a 3] No Man's Canyon may be located via a Precursor door almost immediately after riding an elevator down, though the other three locations may be accessed after walking past the door. To the left, the southern temple may be accessed, though after proceeding further forward, a large pavilion-like hub has two access points to both the northern and eastern temples. Two floating platforms are used in the northern and eastern temple exit points to transport back to the hub.</p>

<!-- dead town -->
<H1 class="MetalHeads2"> Dead Town </H1>

<img class="NestPic" src="JakImages/town.png" alt="" width="100%">
<br><br>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">It is an entirely ruined and abandoned sector of Haven City, not incorporated within the city's "new barrier."[1] It was once a well-established sector in Haven City, evident with the amount of architecture and buildings that once stood there in hospitable condition. The sacred site, an old, historical hut, around which Dead Town was built, contained the Life Seed within it, something of grave interest to the metal heads. When they eventually attacked that part of the city, Baron Praxis pulled back and relinquished the district, leaving anyone outside the new barrier to die. Only the Shadow stayed behind and through unknown means managed to stop the assault, but only preserved the old hut. The rest of the sector suffered ruination, eventually brimming with toxic waters, plants, and other fauna such as glubs and znorkle tooths. Upon first meeting Underground commander Torn, Jak and Daxter receive the mission "Retrieve banner from Dead Town", for which they had to steal the Baron's banner from the top of a ruined tower in order to prove themselves worthy of operating for the Underground movement. The duo managed not only to retrieve the banner, but also caused the tower to collapse in the process.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">The Dig Site was an underground lurker village on the same island as the weapons factory, neighboring the pumping station island. Lurkers were stated by Brutter to have thrived here before the metal heads discovered the hidden village following Baron Praxis' drilling operations. Lurker life was evident with the various huts, a lurker totem, and trapeze lurkers able to be found here.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">The Fortress  was located adjacent to the southern Slums and central Main Town, and served as the primary headquarters for the Krimzon Guard. It also housed the city's prison, as well as a large dark eco factory used for the Dark Warrior Program. Following the Krimzon Guard's reformation into the Freedom League, the fortress was re-painted from red to blue, and was presumably used by the Freedom League until inimical battle rendered the front door inaccessible.the fortress served as the place of the first mission "Escape from fortress": After Daxter found Jak, the duo traveled through the upper networks of the fortress, ending in the facility's drain, where Jak exited the prison from a high-up door. Jak later re-visited the fort in the mission "Blow up ammo at fortress", where he sabotaged one of the Baron's operations on behalf of the Underground. It is in this mission that Jak discovered the Baron's forces were trading eco with metal heads, witnessed when a couple of grunts met some guards at the entrance to the Haven sewers inside the fortress.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">The Port serves as the city's seaport harbor, consisting of a bay of water with cargo ships around the area, lined with a long walkway with access points to other sectors of the city. This sector was home to Krew's Hip Hog Heaven Saloon before it was replaced by Daxter's Naughty Ottsel, and is also home to the city's gun course. The sector is identified with the Industrial Section's red barrier. Among the missions completed in this area include a preliminary race against Erol in the mission "Beat Erol in race challenge", as well as the mission "Destroy cargo in Port", during which Jak had to destroy security monitors placed throughout the bay by Baron Praxis to spy on Krew's operations. The entrance to the Underport, as well as the Underport itself, was located in this sector as well (hence the name), and was visited in the mission "Find Sig in Underport".</p>

<img class="NestPic" src="JakImages/pump.png" alt="" width="100%">
<br><br>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">The Pumping Station a large, tropical island north of Haven City, consisting mostly of large cliffs encrusted with artificial metal architecture and plumbing equipment. It was accessed via an air lock in the Water Slums, or by heading south of a neighboring island home to the landing pad. Baron Praxis shut off the water supply to the Slums in order to root out the Underground movement. Eventually, the Underground's leader Torn received information from his "friend in the Guard" that the valve to turn the water back on is located at the pumping station. After meeting Jak and Daxter and accepting them into the Underground, he sent them on a mission to turn it back on, stating that "if [Jak] survives, the Slums will be indebted to [him]." Jak succeeded in this, restoring water supply to the Slums.</p>

<img class="NestPic" src="JakImages/tomb.png" alt="" width="100%">
<br><br>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">The Tomb of Mar was also known for being the sacred hiding spot of the last Precursor Stone. It was discovered and visited by Jak after the completion of the Seal of Mar and activation of the Light Tower. The tomb previously had a towering statue of Baron Praxis on the roof, which was destroyed by the Light Tower's beam. For many years, Baron Praxis was in a desperate search for the Tomb of Mar in order to gain access to the Precursor Stone and destroy the Metal Heads with a custom piercer bomb, powered by the stone. When Jak collected all three pieces to the Seal of Mar he was able to activate the Light Tower in No Man's Canyon and reached the tomb first. The Underground then intended to use young Jak, "the kid" as the true heir of Mar, to open the Tomb of Mar and "circumvent cunning tests" referred to as the Trials of Manhood. However, the tomb's oracle refused to admit the kid on the grounds that he was too young to face the tests. Jak then forced his way through the door of the tomb as it was closing, and began the tests.</p>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">The Water Slums  is an extension of the Slums district, and is architecturally the same, with decrepit huts, poorly built and undeveloped bridges, and evident disregard. Different from the rest of the Slums however, it consists of a large body of water. It is traversed by squalid and poorly-constructed wooden walkways. Points of interest here include the entrance to the pumping station, the Oracle's hut, and the lurker merchant Brutter's hut. the Water Slums were primarily used to access the pumping station in the northern airlock. However, a few other missions were held here such as the five "Go to the oracle" options, and the "Get seal piece at Water Slums" mission, the former of which Jak used to gain dark powers, and the latter of which entailed a massive deployment of guards from dropships, during which the waters were guarded by a robot guard.</p>

<img class="NestPic" src="JakImages/forest.png" alt="" width="100%">
<br><br>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">Haven Forest  is a vast woodland located west of Haven City and south of Mountain Temple. Although bearing the name of "Haven", it does not appear to be related to the city nor is it incorporated within the city's walls. The naming of the forest could simply be so for historical purposes, rather than any form of extra real estate. Jak first visited Haven Forest in the mission "Catch scouts in Haven Forest", when he was directed by the Shadow to clear out an invasion of metal head scouts. The Shadow used the Tree of Life, located in the south side of the forest, as his "source for power," but noted that he "couldn't protect it much longer. It is before this mission that Jak officially obtained the JET-Board from the Mechanic. Later, Sig told Jak and Daxter to go once again to the forest in the mission "Hunt Haven Forest metal heads", as thirty new and specialized combat metal heads were reported to have taken over the area. Lastly, Jak visited here to give the Shadow the Life Seed so that he may communicate with the plants there and "ask [them] vital questions about [the] future. However, shortly after the exchange, several guards appeared from air trains and attempted to interrupt Samos, whereupon Jak defended him from the attack.</p>

<!-- weapons factory -->
<H1 class="MetalHeads2">Weapons Factory </H1>

<img class="NestPic" src="JakImages/fac.png" alt="" width="100%">
<br><br>

<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">The Weapons Factory was a "secret" weapons facility, used by Krew and Baron Praxis to develop weapons, namely the piercer bomb and prototype roboguards. It is a tall building, situated on the small island that is home to the dig site and landing pad, neighbouring the pumping station island. Jak visited here after being given a top-level security pass by Ashelin Praxis under the directive to intercept a meeting between the Baron and Krew, the former of whom planned to use the developing piercer bomb to crack open the Precursor Stone. The weapons factory is a large facility located on the island neighbouring the pumping station, across from the dig site's elevator. It is met with a staircase leading to a door which requires "black" clearance. The inside is structured primarily with stone. Its primary features are all of the large pools, reservoirs, and pipelines carrying an acidic green sludge, presumably by-product of the experimentation, or fuel for the experiments themselves. The facility is traversed via various conveyors, which are usually switched in direction via a red/blue target, as well as track-guided bridges, capable of changing location via large bolt cranks. Other platforms are also used to traverse the area, such as those which have a target on them for being shot down.</p>
