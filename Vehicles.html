      <H1 class="MetalHeads">Zoomers </H1>
 

      <p class="textcol3" style="text-align: left;">Zoomers are the most common mode of transportation for Haven citizens and are often found parked at set locations throughout the city. They come in a number of different varieties and colours but come down to three different types; the one-seated zoomer, resembling a bike, the two-seated zoomer and the three-seated zoomer, which has an extra seat in the centre. In the "Make delivery to Hip Hog Saloon" mission, Jak had to use a zoomer packed with a shipment of rare eco ore and deliver it to Krew. This particular zoomer is always a common bike zoomer, painted blue with yellow trim, one exactly like the zoomer hanging in the Underground hideout. </p>

<H1 class="MetalHeads4">Krimzon Guard Cruisers </H1>


<p class="textcol32" style="text-align: left;">Heavily armed and armoured, it is used as a patrol zoomer by the Krimzon Guard in Haven City. It allows guards to respond to chases during high alerts, though they only do so during elevated alerts.
  Like their single-seat counterpart, the KG patrol bike, they are mounted in the front with an on-board cannon. Unique to the cruiser is a seldom-used dual turret in the back. When Jak highjacked a cruiser, shooting would automatically use the cannon.</p>

It is more nimble than the Krimzon Guard cruiser, but is weaker in turn, also lacking the dual-barrel turret of its heavy-duty counterpart. Still, it is both stronger and faster than the standard one-seat zoomer used by civilians. Unlike the cruiser, the KG patrol bike was discontinued entirely after the Freedom League replaced the Krimzon Guard, and it was not subsequently seen in use.</p>

The vehicle has a large holding cell in the back and a single seat in the front, and is considerably fast but minimally armoured.  Prison zoomers were used by the Krimzon Animal Control to capture lurker slaves and then "haul them away for reconditioning", as the "lower-class labour force" could still be "dangerous", according to Baron Praxis.[5] This reconditioning was referred to by Krew as one of the Baron's "projects" outside of the city, the details of which were never revealed. </p>

            <p class="textcol3" style="text-align: left;">The air racer, also known as the hoverbike, is a special racing zoomer used in the Mar Memorial Stadium for the sport NYFE racing in Jak II. NYFE Racers have a sleek, light-weight design. The driver sits directly behind the engine, which carries little to no protection. The tail is another mechanism which uses flaps to steer. The racers are incredibly fast, easily faster than the Zoomer, however, they lack a little turning speed and because of their near-nothing Armor any head-on crash will result in the destruction of the driver. </p>

               <p class="textcol3" style="text-align: left;">The Jet-Board is a device capable of hovering above the ground, executing sharp manoeuvres, performing aerobatics, grinding on edges. It is a slow vehicle and relies on compound speed build-up by performing tricks and fluid manoeuvres to maintain swift forward motion. The JET-Board expands and retracts to activate and deactivate, respectively. Jak can simply keep it lodged on his back when it is not needed. In its active state it emits a blue glow. If Jak hits an enemy while using the JET-Board it will harm both the enemy and Jak, however citizens will usually fall to the ground as Jak rides over them. In rare instances, Jak can accidentally dock them with the side of the board, which raises the alarm system. The prototype JET-Board was designed by Keira for use in stunt championships in Haven City. When Jak raced to Keira's garage in record-breaking time, she told him to test the JET-Board out in a stunt course. When he beat the score he was offered a spot in her race team. Later, when Keira learned that her new race member was working for the Underground movement, she gave the first version of the JET-Board to him to complete the mission "Catch scouts in Haven Forest". Jak could then use the JET-Board as he wanted. </p>
