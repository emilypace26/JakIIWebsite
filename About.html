  Jak II is a third person three-dimensional platformer, in which the player controls Jak, an athletically-built human with a familiar core moveset. 
The player will figure out Jak has Dark Eco Powers, able to use powers like Dark Bomb and Dark Blast. Jak is also  rewarded a Morph Gun with several different weapon selections.

Haven City serves as the game's single hub location, through which zoomers can be used to travel, typically stolen from citizens. Later in the game, the JET-Board is introduced and can be used whenever the player wants when obtained. Missions are assigned by certain key characters who are situated at various points within the city, therefore the zoomers and JET-Board are highly relied on. </p>

<H1 class="overview"> Plot</H1>
<p style="text-align: Left" class="OverviewText" >
  After leaving behind their home, Sandover Village, the crew are teleported into Haven city, ruled by Baron Praxis and his Krimzon Guards, who will execute anyone who is an enemy of the Baron. The City has several propaganda stations which declare citizens to give up their freedom in order to be protected by the Baron. The Metal Heads, being at war with Haven, are a deadly race of creatures outside Haven's walls, which have earned themselves a reputation for their devouring of life in the past. The city is also home to powerful crime bosses such as Krew, with much insight into the city.

  Haven City has a Cyber Punk Art Style , featuring different environments, from the Slums to the much richer Main Town.

<H1 class="overview"> Setting</H1>
<p style="text-align: Left" class="OverviewText" >
  The game starts off with a speech given by Samos Hagai, where Jak, Daxter, Keira and Samos are working on activating a rift rider, the precursor device hidden behind the large door at the end of Precursor Legacy, and its accompanying Rift Gate. When the gate is activated a a swarm of creatures are let out, accompanied by a large figure. Jak panics and activates the Rift Rider, propelling the group through the gate. As they are travelling through the rift, the rider is destroyed. The group fall out of the rift and are separated, though all find themselves in Haven City. Jak and Daxter land and are immediately identified by a patrol of the Krimzon Guard, led by Captain Erol. Jak is taken into custody, as Daxter promises to rescue him. Two years later, Jak is in the Fortress, where he has been the subject of a super soldier program. His body has been injected with dark eco. Erol and the Baron Praxis are there. They declare the 'Dark Warrior Program' a failure. They leave, just as Daxter appears to rescue Jak. As Daxter fidgets with the restraints, Jak transforms into the Dark Warrior Program's ultimate goal, Dark Jak. He breaks the binds and then returns to normal, after speaking his first words, "I'm going to kill Praxis!" The pair then escape the fortress into Haven City.
<br>
<br>
  Once outside, they meet an old man and a child. The man introduces himself as Kor. A patrol of Krimzon Guards approach and Kor offers to help Jak if he saves them from the guards. Jak transforms into Dark Jak, and fights off the guards. Per their deal, Kor tells Jak to seek out the Shadow, the leader of the Underground, a resistance movement. When they reach the hideout, Jak and Daxter meet Torn, a high-ranking member of the Underground and their coordinator. He assigns them their first missions and oversees the occasional challenge missions. Torn refuses to let Jak and Daxter meet the Shadow until they have proven themselves loyal to the cause. On one such mission, while infiltrating the Krimson Guard fortress, they find a group of Krimzon Guards supplying eco to a group of Metal Heads when the two factions are meant to be at war. Torn then sends the "Demolition Duo" on a delivery job to the Hip Hog Heaven Saloon, where they meet the foul, morbidly obese mob boss, Krew, and his bodyguard Sig. Jak and Daxter work for Krew for a time, in exchange for upgrades to the Morph Gun.
<br>
<br>
  Samos tells Jak that the boy they saw with Kor is important because he is heir to the throne of Mar, and only he can open the Tomb of Mar, where the Precursor Stone is hidden. The precursor stone is an artefact of great importance, and key to the defeat of the metal heads. Jak and Daxter destroy a statue of the Baron, revealing the Tomb of Mar below and its guardian, an oracle. The young boy is taken to the tomb, but oracle states that the boy is too young to face the Trials of Manhood, and the door begins to shut. Jak and Daxter dive through as it closes. They complete the Trials Of Manhood, and enter the main room, which holds the Precursor Stone. Another oracle tells them that the Metal Heads destroyed the Precursors. Baron Praxis arrives, and despite Jak's efforts, escapes with the Stone.
<br> 
<br> 
  Jak and Daxter finally confront Praxis, along with a squad of guards at the construction site, but Kor appears and reveals himself as Metal Kor, leader of the Metal Heads. Baron Praxis proceeds with a suicide charge, to which Kor responds with a fatal blast. After Kor leaves, Jak and Daxter come out of hiding and approach Baron Praxis, who shows them a second piercer bomb he intended to use all along. In his final moments, Baron Praxis says that Jak is the "supreme weapon". Daxter recovers the Stone, disarms the bomb, and saves the world.
<br>
<br>
  In the end, the group is celebrating at the Saloon, which Daxter takes over and renames "the Naughty Ottsel". Sig reappears, to the excitement of all present, having survived his seemingly fatal battle with the giant Metal-pede. Samos mourns the deaths of all those who gave their lives in pursuit of peace and justice in Haven City. Finally, Sig gives Jak the ruby key, an artefact to bypass all security in Haven City, and says he's designated driver.

For metal heads that either fly or swim (wasp, saw fish, some metal jackets, etc.) and whose skull gems would then become inaccessible upon being defeated, the skull gem will fly directly towards Jak without him having to retrieve it. Some metal heads, while carrying a visible skull gem, do not eject theirs when defeated. For metal heads that were killed by being knocked out of bounds, the skull gem will usually launch back on to a steady platform where it can be collected. However, the skull gem is especially prone to glitching and does not always come back to a sufficient place for collection.

It is a dark, poisonous substance with the ability to transform, infect and sometimes kill any life form or object it comes in contact with. It is considered severely unstable, and the opposite of light eco. It is also responsible for Daxter's transformation from human to ottsel, and Jak's acquisition of dark powers. It was used throughout the series for various purposes including dark eco experiments on humans, weapons, currency, and fuel.
