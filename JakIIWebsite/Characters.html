              <p >  After being rescued by Daxter and escaping from prison, Jak experienced the first display of his dark alter ego while defeating a squad of guards in the Slums. He was asked to do so by Kor, who was disguised as a human working for the Underground, in order to protect a "very important" child. After defeating the guards, Kor directed Jak to the Underground, a rebel movement waging war against Baron Praxis; Kor noting that its leader, the Shadow, could use fighters like him. Kor told Jak to find the hideout in a dead-end valley near the city wall, instructing him to ask for Torn. Upon meeting Torn, Jak was at first rejected. After Jak told the leader that he wished to see the "Shadow," Torn gave him the mission "Retrieve banner from Dead Town", in which Jak succeeded; starting initiation missions for membership to the Underground.

              Daxter is  the supporting sidekick of Jak throughout the game. He is a former human, and was transformed into a Precursor ottsel upon falling into a dark eco silo in The Precursor Legacy. In Jak II, Daxter found Jak and helped him break out of the Haven City fortress prison. Daxter is played in a few sections of the game, when only Daxter could reach certain areas because of his size. He can spin kick, and whack his enemies with a lunging strike forward using his tail. He is also capable of hanging on to netting, allowing him to climb and swing from place-to-place.

              Keira is best known as a talented mechanic, inventor, and racer, having ultimately invented the zoomers, designed and rebuilt a replica of the Rift Rider with the intent of building a replica of the now-destroyed Rift Rider so she can find her friends and return to the past in Sandover Village. She's also Jak's primary love interest up until she met Erol when working as  mechanic, who she lost interest in eventually once finding out how evil Erol was.

            <p >  Kor spent most of Jak II disguised as a human claiming to be a old wanderer, working for the Underground as young Jak's guardian so that he could keep the boy safe until the time came for him to activate last Precursor Stone while also looking for Jak's older form. Kor, with young Jak by his side, met Jak and Daxter in the Slums of Haven City just after Jak's prison break. In the first confrontation, Jak transformed into Dark Jak and saved Kor and the Kid from a squadron of guards from being arrested for suspicion of harboring Underground "fugitives". Kor, in return, informed Jak of the Underground movement, saying they could use warriors like him, and to ask for its leader Torn at a dead-end alley near the city wall. Aforementioned, the Baron of the city had a deal with Kor in that he would provide him with supplies of eco so that the metal heads would only attack the city enough to justify his unjust rule. Kor led Jak to the Underground, and throughout the game would use Jak to sabotage the Baron's search for the Tomb of Mar and for eco supplies to trade with the Metal Heads so that he could justify launching more attacks.

              Brutter served as a civil advocate for the liberty of lurkers who were used as slaves in the city at the time of Baron Praxis' rule, tasking Jak with the missions "Rescue lurkers for Brutter", in which Jak had to destroy Krimzon Animal Control prison zoomers and free the captive lurkers inside. After the death of Baron Praxis, Brutter became captain of the New Krimzon Guard. He also still retained his trinket stand business, selling fish in the market. Brutter later repaid Jak for his good deeds by giving him the location of a seal piece at his hut in the Water Slums, during the mission "Get seal piece at Water Slums". He also provided air assistance via his balloon as a means for transporting the Rift Rider at the Metal Head nest, proceeding after the mission "Defend stadium".

            <p > Onin is an elderly soothsayer, requiring her interpreter, Pecker, to translate a sign language which she used in conjunction with a spell-type ability referred to as "magic", which Samos Hagai could apparently translate as well. Jak first met Onin after Ashelin Praxis directed him to her to learn more about the House of Mar's crest, giving to him her Bazaar pass. After arriving at Onin's tent, Onin transcribes that she was pleased to see Jak again, much to his surprise, which Pecker then replies that the past and future is all the same. This is a foreshadowing of when Jak finally discovers at the end of the game, that the Kid was really Jak himself from when he was a little boy.

              Errol was the commander of the Krimzon Guard while serving as the right hand to Baron Praxis, and later led an uprising of the reformed and expanded Krimzon robotic department known as the KG Death Bots, after his near-death and subsequent resurrection as a robot. He later came into leadership of the surviving Metal Heads, and continued his war against Haven City from his KG war factory while communicating with the oncoming Dark Makers. He desired world domination or destruction, using the powers he believed the Dark Makers would give him upon their arrival. However he was ultimately killed in the Wasteland at the hands of Jak.

                  Sig was first met in Jak II when Torn sent Jak and Daxter to deliver a package of eco ore to Krew at the Hip Hog Heaven Saloon. Sig was the first one the two met in the entrance to the bar, and would later hand Jak his Morph Gun and Scatter Gun mod with it. Eventually, as Jak and Sig grew closer, Sig revealed to them that he thought Krew was "in over his head" and wanted to break away from the crime lord. When Krew obtained the ruby key, he sent Sig down into the Underport to open ancient passageways. When Sig completed the task, metal heads flooded passages and the city, revealing that Krew had sabotaged and betrayed the city. Sig expressed his desire to eliminate Krew in return, though Jak and Daxter already completed such task. Jak and Daxter then escort Sig out of the Underport, and just before the exit elevator, a large metal-pede crashed through the ceiling and fell on top of Sig, crushing the bridge he was standing on, sending him into the dark depths below. Sig was presumed dead until he appeared at the celebration at the Naughty Ottsel towards the end of the game.

                  Krew was a crime lord, smuggler, weapons merchant, former wrestler, and bar owner in Haven City, contracting wastelanders such as Sig to collect artifacts and weapons from outside the city walls, as "any weapon or artifact worth having goes through [his] hands". Krew was first introduced to Jak and Daxter when they were commissioned by Torn to deliver a package of eco ore as some type of payment. While there, Jak was told to prompt information from Krew about the Baron's trading of eco with the Metal Heads. Krew's response to the questions infuriated him, nonetheless he answered Jak's questions and paid him for his services, and also offered him a job as one of his hired guns. As Jak proved himself by accomplishing tasks for Krew, Krew would give him more and more Morph Gun upgrades. However, as time went on, they eventually grew somewhat unfavourable to each other. When Jak is told to lose the NYFE racing championship to Erol on account of a bet he placed, Jak refused, again angering the gambler.
